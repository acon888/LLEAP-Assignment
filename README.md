2. Sikuli RobotFramework library
3. Pycharm IDE, VS Code can also be use in this application
4. LLEAP application version 8.7.3
5. Microsoft OpenJDK
All the required Softwares can be downloaded from the links below under **Downloadable files needed to run this application**

# Steps to install the LLEAP application
Installation of **LLEAP application** can be automated using the `installLLEAP.bat` file found in the scripts folder. All you need to do is copy the **`scripts`** folder into your `C:\` drive. Once the **`scripts`** folder is in your `C:\` drive then open the folder and run the `installLLEAP.bat` file as Administrator. It should be look like the image below.

## Setting up your IDE environment ##
After you download or clone the repository, Open your preferred IDE. (_for me i use Pycharm_)
1. When you first launch Pycharm you will the same image as below or slightly similar since i already use Pycharm so I dont get the Readme file or What's new.
2. Click on the Open icon and then open the folder or repository that you have cloned.
3. Look for the folder that you've downloaded and then click on `Select Folder`
